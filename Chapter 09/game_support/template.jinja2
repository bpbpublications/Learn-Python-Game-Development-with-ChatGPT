I have a {{game}} game in Python. I want you to help me understand the code and support me in making changes.
Please show me the code for the following feature:
{% for item in requirements %}
    {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

{% if code %}
Here is the game code, please make suggestions, but don't add or update the code:
{{code}}
{% endif%}
