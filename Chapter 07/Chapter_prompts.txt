Exercise 7.1
Please write me a demo of an isometric tilemap using Python and Pygame.

The map should consist of 4 terrain tile types: sand (yellow), grass (green), water (blue), ice (white)
Place the tile drawing code in a function called draw_tile
Draw a grid and overlay it to show the individual tiles

Exercise 7.2 
Now please extend this demo by adding a couple more features:

1) give the tiles some depth, say 8 pixels
2) allow the player to scroll around the map using the arrow keys
3) increase the size of the map to 16x16 tiles

Exercise 7.6 
a) I have the base for an isometric tile game using Python and Pygame, here: 
[copy/paste contents of isometric_world_v.2/main.py into conversation window]
I would not like to make this a tile placement editor complete with UI elements like animated menus and buttons.
I want the player to be able to place tiles on the map by using the mouse. The code to do mouse selection is already in place and working. 
When a player clicks the mouse on the map, a menu opens allowing them to select from one of the available tiles. After the player makes the selection the tile map is updated with the new tile

b)
