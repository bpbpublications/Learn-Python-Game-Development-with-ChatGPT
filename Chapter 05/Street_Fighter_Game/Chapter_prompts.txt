I want to add AI controlled opponents to the game. In order to do that I want to break out the control code in the Fighter class to a new Controller class. 

The Controller class should be called by the main game loop and take the current state of the game and the get_action function will return a state changes dictionary that can update the Fighter class. 

The basic state changes dictionary will look something like:
{ 
    "action" : "movement | attacking | jumping | none"
}

Additional parameters will be added to the dictionary based on the type of change:
Movement: return velocity dx 
Attacking: return attack_type 1 or 2
Jumping: no extra data
No action: no extra data

Here is the format of the game_state dictionary that is passed to the Controller class get_action function.
game_state = {
    "fighter_1": {
        "position": fighter_1.rect,
        "alive": fighter_1.alive,
        "health": fighter_1.health
    },
    "fighter_2": {
        "position": fighter_2.rect,
        "alive": fighter_2.alive,
        "health": fighter_2.health
    },
    "round_over": round_over
}
